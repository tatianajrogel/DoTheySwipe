# DoTheySwipe
> Find out if they're secretly on Tinder.

DoTheySwipe is a Progressive Web App (PWA) built with React and Vite. 
This project was a full Figma-to-code implementation — I translated 
the complete UI/UX design into pixel-perfect React components using 
Tailwind CSS, then configured it as an installable PWA with offline 
support and native-like behavior across iOS, Android, and desktop.

## PWA Implementation
DoTheySwipe is fully installable as a Progressive Web App:
